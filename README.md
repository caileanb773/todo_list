After launching the app, type a brief "task description" into the text field and either press
the enter key or click the "+" to the left of the text field to add the task to the list of
active tasks.

To remove a task from the list, simply click the "-" to the left of the active task.

Upon closing the app, the list of active tasks will be saved to "default.txt" in the same
dir that contains the app. When the app is opened again, it will look for "default.txt" and
if it is found, it will load all tasks from the file.
